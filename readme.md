## Calculating Entropy & Information Gain for Decision Tree

Whats is acheived 

- reading CSV file.
- get the main properties. 
- get sample positives.
- get sample negatives. 
- get number of Features. 

Still working on the following: 
- Get the data and count each feature option.
- Calculate the Entropy for each feature.
- Calculate the Information Gain. 

This project is still under developement and I will keep adding to it till it is done.
